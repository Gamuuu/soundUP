PROJECT OVERVIEW: sounduUP

1. INTRODUCTION
   This is a web application built with Next.js (App Router) for an audio equipment business. It features a product catalog, user authentication (Custom & Google OAuth), a shopping cart, and informational pages like "About Us" and "Services".

2. TECHNOLOGIES & TOOLS
   - Core Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router)
   - Frontend: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
   - Backend & Database: Supabase (Auth & Data), Custom Next.js API Routes
   - Icons: Lucide React
   - State Management: React Context API (AuthContext, CartContext)

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
   - **Frontend**: Client-side heavy approach using React Components.
   - **Backend**: Hybrid approach using both direct Supabase Client (for OAuth) and Next.js API Routes (for custom logic/auth).
   - **Data Flow**: Client Components -> API Routes -> Supabase Database.

4. PAGE FUNCTIONALITY & LOGIC

   A. Home (src/app/page.js)
      - Acts as a landing page composing various UI components (Hero, Categories, Promotion, Popular, Gallery).
      - Purely presentational client component.

   B. Products System (src/app/products/)
      - **Main Page (/products)**:
        - Fetches all products via `/api/products`.
        - Groups products into 4 categories: Speaker, Subwoofer, Amplifier, Head Unit.
      - **Category Page (/products/[category])**:
        - Dynamic routing based on category slug.
        - Fetches all products and filters by the current category.
        - Features a client-side "Brand Filter" to toggle product visibility by brand.

   C. Authentication (Hybrid System)
      - **Register (/register)**: Custom form submitting to `/api/auth/register`.
        *Note: Currently stores passwords in plain text (Security Improvement Needed).*
      - **Login (/login)**: Supports two methods:
        1. Email/Password: Verifies against custom API.
        2. Google OAuth: Uses `supabaseAuth.signInWithGoogle()`.
      - **Profile (/profile)**: Protected route. Checks AuthContext/LocalStorage for session.

   D. Shopping Cart
      - Managed via `CartContext`.
      - Persists data to browser `localStorage`.
      - Supports Add, Remove, and Quantity updates.

   E. Other Pages
      - **Service**: Displays installation portfolios via `ServiceGallery`.
      - **Promotion**: Lists active deals via `PromoList`.
      - **Contact**: Contact form and info.
